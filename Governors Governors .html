<div id="wrong19" class="wrong">Incorrect. Doctrine of lapse, in Indian history, is 
formula devised by Lord Dalhousie, Governor-General 
of India (1848–56), to deal with questions of succession 
to Hindu Indian states. According to Hindu law, an 
individual or a ruler without natural heirs could adopt a 
person who would then have all the personal and 
political rights of a son. Dalhousie asserted the 
paramount power’s right of approving such adoptions 
and of acting at discretion in their absence in the case of 
dependent states. The first states that was annexed 
under this policy was Satara in 1848 AD.</div>
